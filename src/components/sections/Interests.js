                  Aside from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During weekends, I am an avid cyclist and do 50km+ rides here in my area. Sometimes I would just to love to stay at home, watch a series or movie, or even play video games.

               <p>You can sometimes catch me play Dota 2, Valorant, or some single player games like Minecraft.</p>
